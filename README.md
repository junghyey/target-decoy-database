# target-decoy-database

## Introduction
target-decoy-database is a project for generating concatenated target decoy databse. This project is inspired by the research paper [1] "Target-decoy search strategy for increased confidence in large-scale protein identifications by mass spectrometry". target-decoy-database contains java code & sample outputs for concatenated target-decoy database generation. It generates decoy data using three approaches: [1] random (completely), deBrujin[2], and [1] reverse. 

## Set up
1. Generates random_result, deBruijn_result, reverse_result directories (outside source code file (src)) </br>
